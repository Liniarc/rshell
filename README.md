###Synopsis

Recreate command shell for CS100 assignment in Haskell 

The shell is capable of taking in a command line and executing it similarlly to how it'd be executed in the Bash shell. 

In addition, there is a clone of ls and cp which which emulates the bash built-in commands.

### Running the file
In order to run this program, you need to have the ghc compiler.

### Bugs
#####rshell
Short-circuit of `&&` and `||` will short-circuit all remaining commands even if remaining commands would normally be executed
e.g. `true || echo 1; echo 2` will not run `echo 2`
This is different from the Bash terminal would create sub operators such that the command would run as `(true || echo 1); echo 2` which would call `echo 2`

Parenthesis are not supported of logical operators (or in general)

Will not work if in script mode

IO redirection of specific file descriptors do not work.
i.e. `$ g++ main.cpp 2> errors` will not work

Any additional strings between the first io message and next connector will be ignored.
i.e. `$ cat < file AAAAA > file2 AAAAA` will ignore `AAAAA`

rshell displays the full path rather than replacing $HOME with ~

running rshell from within rshell will crash when escaped with Ctrl + C

#####ls

ls will output uppercase files before lowercase files

ls will not minimize column lengths and pad all files to the length of the longest file

ls -l has set width of columns. If a cell is too long, it will throw off the entire row (i.e. a file with 100+ links to it)

ls displays the files in order horizontally instead of vertically.

ls assumes screen width of 80 rather than dynamically determining that
